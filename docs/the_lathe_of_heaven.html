    <h5>Ursula K. Le Guinn </h5>
    <p>Le Guin&rsquo;s foresight amazes me. So much has come to pass that is easy to
take her prescience for granted. To quote her foreword in The Left Hand
of Darkness:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The purpose of a thought-experiment, as the term was used by
Schrödinger and other physicists, is not to predict the future - indeed
Schrödinger most famous thought experiment goes to show that the
&ldquo;future,&rdquo; on the quantum level, cannot be predicted - but to describe
reality, the present world. Science fiction is not predictive; it is
descriptive. Predictions are uttered by prophets (free of charge), by
clairvoyants (who usually charge a fee, and are therefore mor honored in
their day than prophets), and by futurologists (salaried). Prediction is
the business of prophets, clairvoyants, and futurologists. It is not the
business of novelists. A novelist&rsquo;s business is lying. Science fiction is
not predictive; it is descriptive. Predictions are uttered by prophets
(free of charge), by clairvoyants (who usually charge a fee, and are
therefore mor honored in their day than prophets), and by futurologists
(salaried). Prediction is the business of prophets, clairvoyants, and
futurologists. It is not the business of novelists. A novelist&rsquo;s business
is lying.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The following excerpts especially stuck with me, given my work in
climate, energy and water. I&rsquo;m not including any passages that include
plot points, only environmental descriptions, so fear not if you haven&rsquo;t
read it. And when you do read this, <strong>keep in mind that the book was
published in 1971</strong>.</p>

<p>On a changing climate:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Blue sky, snow from foothills to peak. Years ago, in the sixties or
seventies, no doubt. The Greenhouse Effect had been quite gradual, and
Haber, born in 1962, could clearly remember the blue skies of his
childhood. Nowadays the eternal snows were gone from all the world&rsquo;s
mountains, even Everest, even Erebus, fiery-throated on the waste
Antarctic shore. But of course they might have colored a modern
photograph, faked the blue sky and white peak; no telling.</p>

<p>Rain was an old Portland tradition, but the warmth—70° F. on the second
of March—was modern, a result of air pollution. Urban and industrial
effluvia had not been controlled soon enough to reverse the cumulative
trends already at work in the mid-Twentieth Century; it would take
several centuries for the CO2 to clear out of the air, if it ever did.
New York was going to be one of the larger casualties of the Greenhouse
Effect, as the polar ice kept melting and the sea kept rising; indeed all
Boswash was imperiled. There were some compensations. San Francisco Bay
was already on the rise, and would end up covering all the hundreds of
square miles of landfill and garbage dumped into it since 1848. As for
Portland, with eighty miles and the Coast Range between it and the sea,
it was not threatened by rising water: only by falling water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on up with me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s raining already.&rdquo; In fact it was,
the endless warm drizzle of spring—the ice of Antarctica, falling softly
on the heads of the children of those responsible for melting it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On rivers:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Willamette was a useful element of the environment, like a very
large, docile draft animal harnessed with straps, chains, shafts,
saddles, bits, girths, hobbles. If it hadn&rsquo;t been useful of course it
would have been concreted over, like the hundreds of little creeks and
streams that ran in darkness down from the hills of the city under the
streets and buildings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On cars:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Roads were not kept up the way they were when the Highway was king;
there were rough bits and pot-holes. But Heather frequently got up to the
speed limit (45 mph) as she drove through the broad, moonlit-twilit
valley, crossing the Yamhill River four times or was it five, passing
through Dundee and Grand Ronde, one a live village and the other
deserted, as dead as Karnak, and coming at last into the hills, into the
forests.</p>
