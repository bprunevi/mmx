<p>I'm starting to write this page on my 30th birthday. Normally I don't think much of birthdays, least of all my own. But lately, I've found myself daydreaming about the future. Maybe in part due to this feeling of emergence from the pandemic's isolation, or maybe it's something that happens to everyone at the three decade mark? Either way, my younger brother Malcolm asked me a few weeks ago "Do you have any tips or examples for making a 5-year plan?" to which I replied "A 5 year plan of what? Business? Personal?" to which HE settled the matter with "Personal." The answer is: not really - aside from work 5-year spreadsheet proforma stuff, I have managed to keep planning to light <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE' target='_blank'>&#123;^start-of-year thematic&#125;</a> stuff. In the past, I've avoided heavy goals or tracking. For example I have no idea how far or fast I run; as long as it feels good, right on (although I do plan to try tracking a few things starting today, using my thirtieth as a year-0 of sorts). But this moment (this one right <strong>*snap*</strong> now) does provide a fertile opportunity for introspection, sharing with some of my closest friends, and most of all daydreaming.</p>
<p>So what belongs in a 5-year plan? First let's call it something else, because to think that one can sit down and devise a "plan" for the next 5 years is total crap. Leaning on the aforementioned concept of yearly themes being better than resolutions, I think the best we can hope for in planning at such a horizon is describing the <em>gestalt</em> of the next demi-decade. Is that too pretentious a word? Whatever. There are four sections that I think belong in a 5-year gestalt:
<ol><li><strong>Relationships</strong>: who you want to be to others, who you want to spend time with, and how you want to grow with your friends and family;</li><li><strong>Craft</strong>: what is your craft and how might that change in the future;</li><li><strong>Experiments</strong>: what experiments do you want to run, be they personal, professional, or existing outside of those realms; and</li><li><strong>Place</strong>: where you want to be, and what that placement means for 1, 2 and 3.</li></ol>
<hr/></p>
<p><strong>* The below sections are in progress *</strong></p>
<h6>Relationships</h6>

<p>Gosh, what a section to start with. Be back in a bit.</p>
<h6>Craft</h6>

<p>A lot of the daydreaming I've mentioned is meditation on what aspects of my work (both "real work" and my hobbies and <a href='projects.html'>&#123;projects&#125;</a>) are most engaging and what about those aspects keep me creatively energized.</p>
<p>I suppose 5 years ago was the start of <a href='upstream_tech.html'>&#123;Upstream Tech&#125;</a>. If my next 5 years can be as productive and "successful" (whatever that meaningless measure means), I'll be glad. I've been fortunate that the past 5 years of work have brought a variety pack of different roles and responsibilities. That miscellany has been valuable in starting to understand the kinds of work, from minutiae to big picture stuff, is most rewarding, and therefore what <em>my craft</em>, in the lifelong sense, could be.</p>
<p>TODO: finish</p>
<h6>Experiments</h6>

<h7>Tracking</h7>

<p>The past five years, I haven't measured a run or taken note of climbing progress. I mostly just try hard and make sure it feels good. There have been brief stings of daily journaling, and Quinault and I got pretty into planning out climbing workouts around 2016/2017 when we were living together. But those have taken more the form of to do lists (a la intentions) rather than progress tracking. I've also done a poor job tracking the kinds of work and output I have on a given day, so I don't have much data to look back on to analyze. In retrospect, be it for exercise, creative pursuits, or work that kind of information would have been invaluable for a 5-year gestalt exercise.</p>
<p>This is to say I hope to start tracking:
<ul><li>Rough time spent on different <a href='projects.html'>&#123;projects&#125;</a></li><li>My <a href='activity_tracker.html'>&#123;physical activity&#125;</a> - but lightly, i.e. how long did I run and how did it feel</li><li><a href='media.html'>&#123;Art and media&#125;</a> I'm consuming beyond reading -- whether films I've watched, albums, or other art, I'd like to start jotting down when works have effects on me, big and small</li></ul>
<h6>Place</h6></p>
<p>I've found myself focusing a bit too much on future potential places to live over the past few years, which have prevented me from ::living in the moment, man::. When I lived in the city, I was obsessed with being closer to natural space and having room to grow food. Living in the liminal space between city and forest (aka <em>the suburbs</em>), I now want both a city and to live in the middle of nowhere. Helpful.</p>
<p>But in thinking about where to go, and telling friends and family about potential spots, it's become clear that the <em>where</em> doesn't matter, it's really about the who else you could convince to be there with you. If I could redo my early 20s, I would try to make some manner of blood pact with my closest friends to live in adjacent living situations (or at least the same cities) for longer. It's amazing how quickly jobs pull a thick social web thinner.</p>
<p>Luckily for me, I've proven to myself that place is not dependent on work. The two are decoupled, whether I'm practicing my craft alone, growing a team, or joining another. My main criteria when I'm thinking about where to live are:
<ol><li>ample natural space full of water, trees, trails, paths</li><li>an artistic and intellectual community</li><li>access to train and air travel</li><li>medium cost of living</li></ol>
So I do forsee moving at some point in the next 5 years, probably closer to the end, but it's really about figuring out who between family and close friends will be where and who can be convinced to be there too.</p>
