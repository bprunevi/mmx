    <h5>An exercise in self-built tooling and learning GoLang</h5>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve historically defaulted to the technology du jour to build and rebuild
my personal and company webpages. It&rsquo;s worked fine - there have been
moments of fantastic efficiency, and others of abysmal reverse
engineering of an errant Gatsby plugin.</p>

<p>In the spirit of <a href='self-sufficient_informatics.html'>{self-sufficient informatics}</a>, and heavily inspired
by others on the <a href='https://webring.xxiivv.com/' target='_blank'>[webring]</a>, I sought out to
simplify my dependencies, build something myself, and learn some new
technologies in the process.</p>

<p>To start, I mapped out my hoped-for characteristics of the end result.
I landed on:</p>

<ul>
<li>low friction (so as to promote more writing);</li>
<li>low-level (no automagic frameworks or dependencies; and</li>
<li>extendable (I want this to be somethign that evolves with me over the next 5, 10, 15 years).</li>
</ul>

<p><a href='https://github.com/XXIIVV/oscean/' target='_blank'>[Devine Lu Linvega&rsquo;s Oscean]</a> served
as the primary inspiration. I spent a weekend pouring over their wiki,
the underlying C-code, and the ecosystem of file formats and prorgams
they created. I could (and <strike>should</strike> will) write a whole
post on the great things I continue to learn from them. The act of
reading through their code and reverse engineering the site compilation
was one of the most fun weekends I&rsquo;ve had in a while. I promise I am fun.
I gained an understanding of their technical approach to linking and
render disparate databases, while simultaneously exploring the content of
those databases themselves.</p>

<p>I opted for GoLang as a learning opportunity. Compared to my usual
Javascript, GoLang is miles closer to C - the last time I thought about
pointers was my senior year of college, if that. I never imagined saying
this, but I missed pointers! My impression of GoLang so far is fine. I
hardly tapped into the features it is known for, such as concurrancy. But
this project served as a gentle introduction.</p>

<p>Another reason I wanted to create the compiler myself was so that I could add
features over time that are typically only available on &ldquo;platforms,&rdquo; such as
bidirectional linking and other memex-style data graph functions.
I noticed that Oscean as well as others on the webring were able to do
this. How cool.</p>

<p>In a moment of doubt, I played with <a href='https://www.11ty.dev/' target='_blank'>[11ty]</a> as well as
<a href='https://github.com/mathieudutour/gatsby-digital-garden' target='_blank'>[gatsby plugins]</a>
that promised functionality I sought. But after speedbumps with
each, always grappling with the obfuscation that make them &ldquo;magic,&rdquo; I felt
confident that I was on the right path.</p>

<p>For my pages, I opted to use a modified version of the human readable
<a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/indental.html' target='_blank'>[Indental]</a> format, and started
by porting a portion of my site to it, and writing a parser to convert it
to Go structs. From there, I linked the structs into a hierarchical tree
and created various rendering functions that converted the ndtl entries
into html, resting a bit on Go&rsquo;s native templating engine. It works
remarkably well, and I am able to easily add features and improvements
over time. For example, I recently added the ability for an entry&rsquo;s body
to contain markdown.</p>

<p>Other features of established web frameworks are replicatable with bash,
usually. For instance, &ldquo;live reloading&rdquo; was achieved with the following
bash:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
bash build.sh
while inotifywait -qqre modify ./src ./links ./data; do
  bash build.sh
done
</code></pre>
