    <h5>This site is called mmx</h5>
    
<img src='img/redturtle020.jpg' alt='A person building something with bamboo'/>

<p>mmx was built at the start of 2021. Largely inspired by others on <a href='https://webring.xxiivv.com/' target='_blank'>webring</a>, especially <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/home.html' target='_blank'>Devine</a>, the site aims to be a long term repository for my writing, notes, and research. Entries on my previous site (a precarious tower of javascript dependencies) were ported over.</p>
<p>The site's compiler is written in <a href='https://golang.org' target='_blank'>Go</a>. It can generate a graph of entries from a modified version of <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/indental.html' target='_blank'>Indental</a> as well as markdown with frontmatter.</p>
<p>Entries have names, hosts, titles, and bodies. They optionally have dates. An entry can optionally embed itself in a parent - <a href='reading.html'>reading</a> being a key example. A reference graph is linked after the entries are generated, enabling inbound and outbound relationships to be formed. <a href='index.html'>now</a> is a special case that has its own generator function to render the timeline.</p>
<p>Go's <a href='https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/' target='_blank'>templating engine</a> is lightly used, but it's often more straightforward to generate the html directly into a string.</p>

<h5>Building mmx</h5>

<p>I've historically defaulted to the technology du jour to build and rebuild my personal and company webpages. It's worked fine - there have been moments of fantastic efficiency, and others of abysmal reverse engineering of an errant Gatsby plugin.</p>
<p>In the spirit of <a href='low_tech.html'>low tech</a>, and heavily inspired by others on the <a href='https://webring.xxiivv.com/' target='_blank'>webring</a>, I sought out to simplify my dependencies, build something myself, and learn some new technologies in the process.</p>
<p>To start, I mapped out my hoped-for characteristics of the end result.
I landed on:</p>
<ul><li>low friction (so as to promote more writing);</li><li>low-level (no automagic frameworks or dependencies; and</li><li>extendable (I want this to be somethign that evolves with me over the next 5, 10, 15 years).</li></ul>
<a href='https://github.com/XXIIVV/oscean/' target='_blank'>Devine Lu Linvega's Oscean</a> served as the primary inspiration. I spent a weekend pouring over their wiki, the underlying C-code, and the ecosystem of file formats and prorgams they created. I could (and <strike>should</strike> will) write a whole post on the great things I continue to learn from them. The act of reading through their code and reverse engineering the site compilation was one of the most fun weekends I've had in a while. I promise I am fun. I gained an understanding of their technical approach to linking and render disparate databases, while simultaneously exploring the content of those databases themselves.

<p>I opted for GoLang as a learning opportunity. Compared to my usual Javascript, GoLang is miles closer to C - the last time I thought about pointers was my senior year of college, if that. I never imagined saying this, but I missed pointers! My impression of GoLang so far is fine. I hardly tapped into the features it is known for, such as concurrancy. But this project served as a gentle introduction.</p>
<p>Another reason I wanted to create the compiler myself was so that I could add features over time that are typically only available on "platforms," such as bidirectional linking and other memex-style data graph functions. I noticed that Oscean as well as others on the webring were able to do this. How cool.</p>
<p>In a moment of doubt, I played with <a href='https://www.11ty.dev/' target='_blank'>11ty</a> as well as <a href='https://github.com/mathieudutour/gatsby-digital-garden' target='_blank'>gatsby plugins</a> that promised functionality I sought. But after speedbumps with each, always grappling with the obfuscation that make them "magic," I felt confident that I was on the right path.</p>
<del>For my pages, I opted to use a modified version of the human readable <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/indental.html' target='_blank'>Indental</a> format, and started by porting a portion of my site to it, and writing a parser to convert it to Go structs. From there, I linked the structs into a hierarchical tree and created various rendering functions that converted the ndtl entries into html, resting a bit on Go's native templating engine. It works remarkably well, and I am able to easily add features and improvements over time. For example, I recently added the ability for an entry's body to contain markdown.</del>

<p>Other features of established web frameworks are replicatable with bash, usually. For instance, "live reloading" was achieved with the following bash:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
bash build.sh
while inotifywait -qqre modify ./src ./links ./data; do
  bash build.sh
done</code></pre>

<p>The site is hosted using Github pages. This is great, because there is no build step. I check in the built files (in /doc) and they are served within seconds. CNAME setup was a breeze.</p>
