    <h5>David Byrne</h5>
    <p>Hilariously, I assumed it was a different David Byrne from the Rock and Roll
Hall of Famer. Who knew he was such a bike nut? Well, apparently he is, and a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37IDIUOJA6s">a big NYC bike advocate to
boot</a>. And I learned later
that my dad met him on the way up to a studio and David was always sweaty
and clutching a bike helmet. Badass! He travels with a folding bike
wherever he goes. This book was his reflections on the cities he had
traveled to, with short snippets of his experience of the city and its
design via bike. From there, Byrne riffs (hah) on the history, culture,
and personal relationships to the place. I read it at a point where I was
returning to my love of bicycling, so I especially appreciated this lens. As
a nice cross-over, he mentions city planning via Robert Moses (one of Caro&rsquo;s
subjects) and references Caro&rsquo;s work, as well as <em>The Life and Death of Great
American Cities</em> which I look forward to reading.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, we’re out of town. Herons skim wetlands and wade in
brackish water. East Coast second-growth forests appear—skinny little trees,
densely packed.</p>
