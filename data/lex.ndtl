    I'm 29 and live in Medford, MA. I grew up in Nashville, TN.

    I make {music|short songs}, am {garden|learning to grow living things}, and am trying to
    make writing a more regular activity. I used to be a strong rock climbing
    -- you could find me in the local rock gym on most days; these days you
    can find me in the Middlesex Fells running on the trails.

    About 5 years ago, I found my work misaligned with my concept of {an appeal for impact|impact}.
    Shortly after, I started {https://upstream.tech|Upstream Tech} with my pal {https://twitter.com/aldenks|Alden} to see
    if we could use our skills to aid efforts in environmental conservation and
    renewable energy. It's going well so far, we think. We really enjoy our work,
    are humbled by those we work with, and the team is more than {https://upstream.tech/team|20 amazing people}. Along the way, I have learned a lot about the complexities -- and
    context -- of water/climate/energy, the excitement and terrors of growing a
    remote team, and (in the most cliche way possible) myself.

    This site is called {mmx}. It is my place to write, research and share ideas.

    Snappi was developed while living in San Francisco and working at Mozilla in the Summer of 2012. At Mozilla I was on the infosec team, and my project was to containerize Firefox's process. The project to sandbox Firefox was incredibly difficult, and progress to understand the build process was slow. To mix it up, I spent spare time developing a native OSX application that allowed quick sharing of files and screenshots. It integrated with services like Evernote and Dropbox.

    {^youtube|rt7zivSrJeE}

    Thankfully, I've gotten better at making these videos.

    > Snappi is the quickest way to share screenshots and files with your friends. Once you take a screenshot or select one or more files, a unique, shortened link will be generated and copied to your clipboard; all you have to do is press paste!

    > Snappi is lightweight, unobtrusive and runs in the background of your desktop. Each file is automatically uploaded to an Evernote notebook, keeping everything neat, organized and accessible.


    It was a great way to learn Objective-C, not to mention the end-to-end process of designing and market a tool to the public. It was my first time too as being the sole recipient of customer input and feedback. Even though the tool itself was lighthearted, I took any input seriously and made improvements quickly.

Into the Static

    ![screenshot of intothestatic.com](./img/into-the-static.jpeg)
    Into The Static (previously hosted at intothestatic.com) was an application that collected videos from Instagram for a specified keyword and played them in a neverending sequence. As new videos were posted, they were pushed into the front of the queue so you often got the feeling like you were watching a network of "live" CCTV cameras. One of my favorite moments was watching #snow right at the first snowfall of the year, as videos punctuated the static in increasing frequency. More sobering was using it to see a livestream of protests in Venezuela in 2014.

    Oddly, folks noticed, and at one point the database had indexed over a million videos as people tested out different keywords.

    <blockquote>
    Dear TV,

    You‚Äôve had a good run.

    Love,
    Into the Static

    It‚Äôs the latest innovation in time-wasting excellence, it compiles and plays all the best/weirdest/randomest Vine and Instagram videos out there, and it‚Äôs online now.

    This. Now... this is a treasure. Basically, it‚Äôs like one very sick (and intelligent) individual took all the best short videos in the world and put them on shuffle. And it‚Äôs every bit as bizarre and terrifying as that sounds.

    Here‚Äôs what you do. You go to the site, you log in with your Instagram account‚Äîif you don‚Äôt have one, you can still watch the videos‚Äîand you type in whatever hashtag your heart and/or insatiable curiosity desires. Then, this thing trolls the entire Vinesphere/Instagramaverse and plays you whatever it finds. And that‚Äôs when amazing happens.

    There was international coverage as well. They had a more sober view on the possibility to view important world events like the then ongoing unrest in Ukraine and Venezuela.

    <blockquote>

    ~2019. In one of my earlier bouts of {self-sufficient informatics}, I sought to decrease all time spent on large corporations' social media sites. The minor irony being that I relied on Google cloud infrastructure for fast implementation. An acceptable concession.

    <img src='./img/werm-world-2.png' style='float:right; height: 30rem'/>

    The site is a mobile-optimize React application, backed by Firebase with a few serverless functions for async operations such as image processing and email notification of new posts. The first iteration of the site, which allowed for posting of images, was built in a weekend and additional functionality like posting other types of media (text, audio) were added over time. One experimental feature was added to allow multiple media (from any user) to be attached horizontally to a post, with a horizontal scrolling element added to see them.

    Users were organized into groups, and each group had one long feed of posts.

    Usage died off for a variety of reasons. I hope to revive this project, potentially as a bona-fide app so that notifications can be sent (not by email). Everyone who used it remembers it fondly.

Upstream Tech
  HOST : active projects
  BREF : Upstream Tech
  BODY : 
    {https://upstream.tech|Upstream Tech} is a public benefit corporation founded in 2016 by Marshall and Alden. It currently provides two services:

    1. {https://upstream.tech/lens|Lens}, monitoring software for environmental organizations.
    2. {https://upstream.tech/hydroforecast|HydroForecast}, a hydrologic forecasting service used by renewable energy utilities and conservation organizations.

    In it's early days, we did a number of consulting projects, including two citizen science applications: the New York State's Herp Shark Count for the Galapagos Islands. After attending a lecture by Dr. Grey Nearing, who later became an advisor and briefly our Director of Research, we honed in a satellites and machine learning as tools we could leverage given our previous experience and technical strengths. 
    
    The first non-consulting project was a remote compliance tool for water transfers in the Western U.S. In the West, water rights are purchased or leased by conservation organizations with the aim to transfer water from agriculture use to environmental use to increase flows in streams and rivers for the benefit of freshwater species. Our service allowed organizations to remotely monitor that this transfer indeed occurred and that the water was not used on the farm field - a monitoring process that would typically require costly in-person visits througout the season. These visits diverted resources that could otherwise be applied to additional conservation projects. A classifer was used to predict the liklihood that a field was irrigated or not. The bones of this application later became our data processing pipeline for satellite imagery and machine learning.

    ![An Upstream Tech prototype](./img/upstream-proto-1.jpg)

    From there, we became fascinated with anachronous design and complexity of water rights. We built a system that digitized a number of states' water rights, and used the same classifier as before to predict year-over-year water use. An aim was to build a database of water rights that on paper appeared low-value, but reliably applied water to their fields. Another was to identify farm fields that had not used water for a certain number of consecutive years, which would invalidate the claim - a radical and contentious application of technology which would have been dangerous to release without a fuller understanding of the politics and local contexts. Even with some of these databases built, we learned that water rights require handshakes and hat tips and we were trying to apply a scalable solution to a problem that wasn't ready to "scale." So we switched gears back to our compliance monitoring.

    We met with The Nature Conservancy's {https://www.scienceforconservation.org/science-in-action/birdreturns|Bird Returns} program via an introduction from our advisor Brian Richter, the then Director of International Water at The Nature Conservancy. The program applies management guidelines to rice fields in the Pacific Flyway, providing vital habitat for migratory birds in the Spring and Fall. After discussion with the team's leads, Katie Andrews and Ethan Inlander, we determined that our previous compliance monitoring software could be used to monitor projects in the BirdReturns portfolio. We launched this program, and over time it evolved into what is now Lens.

    ![The team visited a project location in the Sacramento area](./img/birdreturns-1.jpg)
    _The team visited a project location in the Sacramento area_

    In parallel, we met Gia Schneider from Natel Energy via a meandering series of introductions. Natel Energy developes a hydropower turbine that uniquely allows for 100% safe fish passage. After breakfast together in Boston, we realized we were working on the same underlying problems from very different angles: Natel Energy via hardware and project development; Upstream Tech via software solutions - both with the aim at improving the health of watersheds and building climate resilience. After a few months of discussion and brainstorming, we decided to {upstream joins natel energy|join forces}. Learning about hydropower via Gia and the Natel team, we realized there was an opportunity to apply our machine learning and satellite technology to watershed management and planning, and more specifically starting with hydropower operations. This was the birth of our second product, HydroForecast.

Entries on my previous site (a tower of tangled javascript dependencies) were ported over.

    The site's compiler is written in {https://golang.org|Go}. It can generate a graph of entries from a modified version of {https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/indental.html|Indental} as well as markdown with frontmatter. 
    
    Entries have names, hosts, titles, and bodies. They optionally have dates. A host can optionally embed its children - {reading} being a key example. A reference graph is linked after the entries are generated, enabling inbound and outbound relationships to be formed. {home} is a special case that has its own generator function to render the timeline.

    Go's {https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/|templating engine} is lightly used, but it's often more straightforward to generate the html directly into a string (it's a "functional component" after all).

The Three Sisters
  HOST : Garden
  BREF : The Three Sisters
  BODY : 
     Corn should be planted first so that it can grow tall above the other crops. Plant seeds for Sister Bean 2-3 weeks later, or at least when the corn is a few inches tall. When the beans are sending out tendrils to climb the corn will be tall enough to support them. Plant Sister Squash seeds 1 week later after the beans have emerged. You don't want the large squash leaves to shade out young corn and bean seedlings before they have time to establish.

    > For millennia, from Mexico to Montana, women have mounded up the earth and laid these three seeds in the ground, all in the same square foot of soil. When the colonists on the Massachusetts shore first saw indigenous gardens, they inferred that the savages did not know how to farm. To their minds, a garden meant straight rows of single species, not a three-dimensional sprawl of abundance. And yet they ate their fill and asked for more, and more again.

    > Once planted in the May-moist earth, the corn seed takes on water quickly, its seed coat thin and its starchy contents, the endosperm, drawing water to it. The moisture triggers enzymes under the skin that cleave the starch into sugars, fueling the growth of the corn embryo that is nestled in the point of the seed. Thus corn is the first to emerge from the ground, a slender white spike that greens within hours of finding the light. A single leaf unfurls, and then another. Corn is all alone at first, while the others are getting ready.

    > Drinking in soil water, the bean seed swells and bursts its speckled coat and sends a rootling down deep in the ground. Only after the root is secure does the stem bend to the shape of a hook and elbow its way above ground. Beans can take their time in finding the light because they are well provisioned: their first leaves were already packaged in the two halves of the bean seed. This pair of fleshy leaves now breaks the soil surface to join the corn, which is already six inches tall.

    > Pumpkins and squash take their time‚Äîthey are the slow sister. It may be weeks before the first stems poke up, still caught in their seed coat until the leaves split its seams and break free. I‚Äôm told that our ancestors would put the squash seeds in a deerskin bag with a little water or urine a week before planting to try to hurry them along. But each plant has its own pace and the sequence of their germination, their birth order, is important to their relationship and to the success of the crop.

    > The corn is the firstborn and grows straight and stiff; it is a stem with a lofty goal. Laddering upward, leaf by long-ribbed leaf, it must grow tall quickly. Making a strong stem is its highest priority at first. It needs to be there for its younger sister, the bean. Beans put out a pair of heart-shaped leaves on just a stub of a stem, then another pair, and another, all low to the ground. The bean focuses on leaf growth while the corn concentrates on height. Just about the time that the corn is knee high, the bean shoot changes its mind, as middle children are wont to do. Instead of making leaves, it extends itself into a long vine, a slender green string with a mission. In this teenage phase, hormones set the shoot tip to wandering, inscribing a circle in the air, a process known as circumnutation. The tip can travel a meter in a day, pirouetting in a loopy circle dance until it finds what it‚Äôs looking for‚Äîa corn stem or some other vertical support. Touch receptors along the vine guide it to wrap itself around the corn in a graceful upward spiral. For now, it holds back on making leaves, giving itself over to embracing the corn, keeping pace with its height growth. Had the corn not started early, the bean vine would strangle it, but if the timing is right, the corn can easily carry the bean.

    > Meanwhile, the squash, the late bloomer of the family, is steadily extending herself over the ground, moving away from the corn and beans, setting up broad lobed leaves like a stand of umbrellas waving at the ends of hollow petioles. The leaves and vines are distinctly bristly, giving second thoughts to nibbling caterpillars. As the leaves grow wider, they shelter the soil at the base of the corn and beans, keeping moisture in, and other plants out.

    > Native people speak of this gardening style as the Three Sisters.

Space mystery game concept
  HOST : research & notes
  BREF : A mystery point-and-click concept set in space
  BODY : 
    My attempts to make games thus far have been thwarted by shiny tools and a tendency to over-complicate the building process. I've played with both Godot and Unity, and while initial experiments have clearly illustrated their power as game engines, this game concept strips away my typical rabbit holes (complex game/physics/graphics) to focus on narrative and game mechanics.

    The game is a Myst-like, set on a spacecraft. The player navigates between rooms and views within the rooms, such as a close-up of a control panel or viewport. Various elements within each view are interactive. Puzzles related to this narrative will present themselves over time to enable access to new areas of the ships, or modify previous views that have already been visited.

    The game starts with the player awaking from a hibernation pod. There are no other evident signs of other crew members, and the player cannot remember why they are on the spacecraft.
