    I'm 29 and live in Medford, MA. I grew up in Nashville, TN.

    I make {music|short songs}, am {garden|learning to grow living things}, and am trying to
    make writing a more regular activity. I used to be a strong rock climbing
    -- you could find me in the local rock gym on most days; these days you
    can find me in the Middlesex Fells running on the trails.

    About 5 years ago, I found my work misaligned with my concept of impact.
    Shortly after, I started {https://upstream.tech|Upstream Tech} with my pal {https://twitter.com/aldenks|Alden} to see
    if we could use our skills to aid efforts in environmental conservation and
    renewable energy. It's going well so far, we think. We really enjoy our work,
    are humbled by those we work with, and the team is more than {https://upstream.tech/team|20 amazing people}. Along the way, I have learned a lot about the complexities -- and
    context -- of water/climate/energy, the excitement and terrors of growing a
    remote team, and (in the most cliche way possible) myself.

    This site is called {mmx}. It is my place to write, research and share ideas.

    ### Active
    - {mmx}, this site.
    - {@carbonfreegrid}, a Twitter bot that tweets daily statistics about the previous day's U.S. energy production, highlighting low- and high-carbon generation.

    ### Previous/Dormant
    - {werm.world}, (a briefly) successful attempt to create a micro social network for a few dozen friends.
    - {https://github.com/Mutual-Aid-Medford-and-Somerville/mamas-needs-offers|MAMAS Needs/Offers}, a website that listed "needs" and "offers" for mutual aid in Somerville and Medford. It pulled from a spreadsheet as the backing database for easy management and updating.
    - {https://github.com/mrshll/climatework.org|climatework.org}, a website that listed jobs in climate-focused fields such as renewable energy and conservation.
    - Into The Static, a site that collected all videos from a social media site for an inputted keyword and played them in a neverending sequence.
    - Future Phone, an application that allowed you to leave yourself a voicemail which would be redelivered far in the future.

    ~2019. In one of my earlier bouts of {self-sufficient informatics}, I sought to decrease all time spent on large corporations' social media sites. The minor irony being that I relied on Google cloud infrastructure for fast implementation. An acceptable concession.

    <img src='./img/werm-world-2.png' style='float:right; height: 30rem'/>

    The site is a mobile-optimize React application, backed by Firebase with a few serverless functions for async operations such as image processing and email notification of new posts. The first iteration of the site, which allowed for posting of images, was built in a weekend and additional functionality like posting other types of media (text, audio) were added over time. One experimental feature was added to allow multiple media (from any user) to be attached horizontally to a post, with a horizontal scrolling element added to see them.

    Users were organized into groups, and each group had one long feed of posts.

    Usage died off for a variety of reasons. I hope to revive this project, potentially as a bona-fide app so that notifications can be sent (not by email). Everyone who used it remembers it fondly.

    ![A person building something with bamboo, from The Red Turtle](./img/redturtle020.jpg)

    mmx was {building mmx|built} at the start of 2021. Largely inspired by others on {https://webring.xxiivv.com/|webring}, especially {https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/home.html|Devine}, the site aims to be a long term repository for my writing, notes, and research. Entries on my previous site (a tower of tangled javascript dependencies) were ported over.

    The site's compiler is written in {https://golang.org|Go}. It can generate a graph of entries from a modified version of {https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/indental.html|Indental} as well as markdown with frontmatter. 
    
    Entries have names, hosts, titles, and bodies. They optionally have dates. A host can optionally embed its children - {reading} being a key example. A reference graph is linked after the entries are generated, enabling inbound and outbound relationships to be formed. {home} is a special case that has its own generator function to render the timeline.

    Go's {https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/|templating engine} is lightly used, but it's often more straightforward to generate the html directly into a string (it's a "functional component" after all).

      The wood thrush, it is! Now I know<br/>
      who sings that clear arpeggio,<br/>
      three far notes weaving<br/>
      into the evening<br/>
      among leaves<br/>
      and shadow;<br/><br/>
      or at dawn in the woods, I've heard<br/>
      the sweet ascending triple word<br/>
      echoing over<br/>
      the silent river ‚Äî<br/>
      but never<br/>
      seen the bird.

    Being largely confined at home in 2020, I took on many personal and introspective projects. One of the major draws for me to move slightly out of the city was to have more space for outdoor projects. I hope 2021 will be a season of bounty, where I can look forward to tending the beds daily and sharing the harvest with my neighbors and friends. I also hope to transform the vegetables into {the art of fermentation|experimental ferments}
