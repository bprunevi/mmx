  BODY :
    <p>Long hike today. Alejandra pulled some DCR records and learned about a
    trolly that used to be in {the Fells}. We traced the path of the old
    tracks and discovered some new trails in the process. I thought I had
    been on everything at this point. Otherwise, I'm infatuated with the
    concept of the fediverse/DIY internet culture that exists outside of the
    tools and technologies that are so prevalent. So after reading a lot of C
    code, I decided to try to right my own static site generator. I picked
    GoLang for the fun of it, but we'll see how far that gets. In the end I
    might go with C or, reluctantly, python. In any case, it doesn't feel
    productive in the least, but I'm having a nice time learning a new
    language and combing through the C code. It's been a while since I've
    gotten to do that.</p>

  BODY :
    <p>Worked today, because Alejandra had to. But having the day to myself
    is a gift. It reminds me of the early days of prototyping and
    experimenting with Upstream. A good reminder in the New Year to save time
    for myself to be creative and make things, rather than just meet and
    manage.</p>
    <p>We had a quiet NYE, making a new Trinidadian curry recipe, that I was
    admittedly overwhelmed by, shucked some oysters and called family. We’ve
    been cooped up for almost the whole year, but the truth is, I’m not sure
    what we would do if the doors were unlocked and we could see whomever we
    pleased. Would we be in Nashville? Would Henry be here? In any case, a
    good reminder to stay weird and broaden my social circles as soon as
    society is ready for it.</p>
    <p>Also, finished the Prince book. What next?</p>

  BODY :
    <p>I'm almost done with The Making of Prince of Persia. It's the game
      creator's journal entries from the years surrounding the development of the
      game, unedited and presented plainly. It's clear how integral the act of
      frequent reflection via journaling was for the author, so I'm going to give
      it a shot again. It's been years since I last wrote in one of my moleskins.
      Today was nice - Alejandra and I took most of the day off, which was
      possible since things are so quiet this time of year. We took Daxter to the
      Sheepfold, where he sprinted and was amicable to other pups. We finished
      with a short hike. Alejandra made some great sandwiches, cutting them
      nearly to emulate a British tea time. Things otherwise are copacetic. I've
      been surprisingly fine without social outlets during the past 8 months of
      the pandemic, but it's starting to worry me. Will I be able to kickstart my
      old friendships? I'll spend some time ending the year writing letters and
      correspondence to pals new and old.</p>
