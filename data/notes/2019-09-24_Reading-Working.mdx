I first heard about Caro when my partner, Alejandra, slammed down the 1,336 page tome
_The Power Broker_. This much less intimidating book was a great
introduction to Caro's eloquence, and actually quite glad it was my first:
it highlights his approach to the craft of biographical research and
writing. That background, I feel, will give me a deeper appreciation for
the works I plan to read this winter.
