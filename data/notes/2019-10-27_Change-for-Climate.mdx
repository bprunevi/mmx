I've been a conservationist since I was a kid, but not the waders-in-wetland
kind. The toothpaste conservationist. The type of person who's heart rate
spikes, not while running up a hill, but when the refrigerator door is left
open. The kind that wears a coat inside, when no one else is home. A huge fan of
"blankets." Curiously, some find these persuits obnoxious.

And alas, it wasn't even tied to any virtuous cause; was I attempting to save
money? I had a loose concept of what leaving the refrigerator open for an extra
minute really cost, so at the time, my motives were poorly quantified. But a
conservationist, efficiency obssessed, I was.

Only in the past few years did I become aware of the quotidien behaviors that
contribute to climate change and environmental degredation. Finally, a framework
with which I could quantify wasteful behavior! Rooting out every day
inefficiencies now were in pursuit of small (miniscule, really) movements
towards a lower impact life.

Here, I will capture the inspirations I encounter as I attempt to lower my
carbon and environmental footprint, and the resulting changes I may to
day-to-day life.

# Diet

I was recently invited to a dinner hosted by one of the leading river
conservation groups in the country. The venue? A steakhouse. The vegetarian
option? Salmon. A discordance of mission and substance like this feels like
you're being conned.

The same can be said of those who call for rapid, urgent solutions to climate
change and yet who refuse to consider alternatives to their double-meat chipotle
dinner. The argument that no single individual change can make a meaningful
difference is obviously true. And yet, we have quantified the massive impact of
collective change. [FAO estimates that livestock contributes to 14.5% of global
GHG emissions](http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/197623/icode/). Woah!

Imagine for a second that we had fully renewable, electrified cars, planes and trucks.
Incredible right? So much focus is on transportation electrification (maybe because it centers
on cool, new gadget-filled consumer goods). But brace for it -- if human
consuption shifted to a mostly vegetarian diet, we would would reduce GHG emission
_the same amount_ as if we fully transformed our transportation. **And** we
wouldn't have to do all the crazy damaging things that come along with battery
production. A simple, acheiveable change that can happen TODAY.

So reading articles like the New York Times' fantastic [guide to eating more
sustainabily](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/30/dining/climate-change-food-eating-habits.html),
it became an absolute no-brainer to stop eating meat. February of 2019, I
scaled my meat consumption back to only eating small fish and bivalves. Now I
typically will have small fish/bivalves once a month.

_"But what about my muscles/physical activity/Peloton training plan?!"_ The
number of veg/vegan atheletes continues to grow. Alex Honold certainly has no
issue with strength or endurance. Elephants are nature's strongest vegetarians.
I am training for an ultra marathon right now, and am running faster than ever -
fueled by almost entirely vegetables. I hardly noticed a significant shift in my
energy levels while changing my diet.

Staples for me include:

- Chickpeas
- Tofu, tempeh, and seitan
- Nuts
- Broccoli and cauliflower (who knew it had so much protein?)
- Beans
- Mushrooms

It's been a great reboot to my cooking. We joined a CSA and get tons of
exciting vegetables to experiment with. We added a mushroom share, so get a ton
of nutrient-right shrooms to add to our meals.

There is still an opportunity for me to improve: we still buy eggs, cheese
and milk (although we have been increasingly replacing milks with options like Oatly).
Eggs aren't so bad environmentally. Cheese is worse than poultry, pork, and
fish. Yikes. While alternative meat options have come a long way, and are now carried
by every single major grocery chain, I have yet to see an impressive selection
of alternative cheeses. If you know of some you like - let me know! I'd love to
start trying alternatives.
