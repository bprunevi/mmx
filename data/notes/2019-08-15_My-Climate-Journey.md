I met Jason early on in his climate journey. Via Twitter I think? Always
funny when I realize that retrospectively. We exchanged a couple of thoughts
online and then had a coffee. A few months later, he had his podcast up and running
and I had been enjoying the episodes.

I especially enjoyed the episode with {https://www.myclimatejourney.co/episodes/pamela-templer|Pamela Templer} of Boston University. Her explanations were approachable and down to earth. The episode with {https://www.myclimatejourney.co/episodes/pat-brown|Pat Brown} of Impossible Foods was unsurprisingly a favorite as well. Right now, I have a long backlog to catch up on.

I wanted to discuss how we arrived at Upstream Tech, as unlikely contributors to climate change solutions, and how I think everyone can -- and many more people need to -- {an appeal for impact|play a role in implementing creative, urgent solutions}.
