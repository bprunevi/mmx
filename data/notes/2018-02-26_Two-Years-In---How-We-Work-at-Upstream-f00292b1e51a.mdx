Obviously my desktop background‚Ä¶

Ah yes, the unflappable entrepreneur: knowing from Day 1 that their business will last decades‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänay a century! Not I.

If you told me, approximately two years ago, that Upstream would not only last two years, but continually gain momentum I‚Äôd respond ‚Äúof course, of course!‚Äù but my stomach would ache with uncertainty. Alden and I were, after all, [testing a thesis](https://medium.com/@marsh/an-appeal-for-impact-144c8022b41f) (we still are‚Ää‚Äî‚Äächeck back in a few decades).

Our thesis is this: It is possible for folks _in our line of work_ to make a living working on something that also has positive social and environmental returns.

It‚Äôs sort of like the ‚Äútriple bottom line‚Äù of investing (financial, social and environmental returns), but for day-to-day work. There are, of course professions where this is the default: teaching, social work, activism, journalism, etc. In our case we were looking specifically at technology‚Äôs role. And so far, so good! 2 years in, we‚Äôre working with some of the most incredible conservation groups, growing the team, and learning from some of the brightest folks in this line of work. We‚Äôve also [joined Natel Energy](https://medium.com/upstream/upstream-joins-natel-energy-6f447da6fd52), which has opened many new doors and allowed us the stability to take greater risks.

It seemed appropriate at this milestone to reflect a bit, not just on how we started, but how we work‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe minutia that make the day-to-day successful. Did I mention we are a remote team? Some of this may be obvious, all of it can be improved, but here is a glimpse into how we work:

### Tools

#### **Slack**

Every technology company under the sun uses [Slack](https://slack.com/) these days. Beyond integrated bots ([Drift](https://www.drift.com/), [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com), etc), we have one particularly interesting room called _#upsteam-intentions_. Every morning, folks post ‚Äúintentions‚Äù for the day. As they day goes on, we edit our intentions to show that something is done. It‚Äôs a very simple, low friction todo list that drive self-accountability, makes progress transparent and helps structure our morning syncs.

#### **Gitlab**

We love [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com). We use a *monorepo*‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa single repository for all our code: frontend, mobile, backend, workers and machine learning all in one place. Sounds like a Huge Mess‚Ñ¢ but because we put each system in its own folder, things stay nice and clean. We are able to share constants and code, run integration tests and do CI testing and autodeployment very easily with everything in the same place. Gitlab‚Äôs CI runner support is fantastic, and we run a few CI machines on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).

We also use Gitlab‚Äôs issues and boards to keep track of technical problems and features. As a fellow remote team, it‚Äôs often clear that they‚Äôve thought through how to make technical collaboration hum. Don‚Äôt tell Gitlab, but I have no idea how all of this is free‚Ä¶

#### **Google Drive**

Team Drives. Nothing revolutionary here.

#### **Figma**

Between the fantastic ecosystem of reusable components and a fairly minimal user interface, we don‚Äôt have to do immense amounts of design. But when we do, be it a marketing graphic or a website layout mockup, we use [Figma](https://www.figma.com). It‚Äôs a great way for our remote team to collaborate and give feedback on designs.

### **Sales and marketing tools**

#### Drift

Boo!

Alden and I were the first two employees at [Drift](https://www.drift.com/), so it‚Äôs awesome to get to use it to chat with our customers. Curious visitors and existing customers use it to send us quick queries that we can respond to in seconds via a Slack integration.

#### Prosperworks

As much as I wanted to continue using a spreadsheet for our CRM, we needed a tool that let us collaborate on sales more fluidly. Since we‚Äôre already deep in the Google Apps world, Prosperworks automatically pulls in contacts, emails and events so that anyone on the Upstream team can check out previous conversations and pick up opportunities as needed without huge knowledge transfers. Very helpful as we grow!

#### Soapbox

We treat our customers like partners, because well‚Ä¶ they are! The existence of our technology alone would do nothing for the environment; it is only in our partners‚Äô hands that Upstream achieves its mission. So to that end, we spend a lot of time sending personalized, in-depth video walkthroughs and follow ups to prospective organizations. And of course, to our existing partners we send video onboarding, updates and answers. In the beginning, I‚Äôd record my screen with Quicktime and then do an overdub with iMovie or Final Cut. Woof, talk about ‚Äúa lot of time.‚Äù

One of the cofounders at Wistia messaged me about a new product they were working on. It allowed simultaneous recording of face and screen, seamless in-browser editing between the two. It was called [Soapbox](https://wistia.com/soapbox), and holy crow was I excited. I could simultaneously record my screen, talk and make it way more personal and candid with a video of me‚Ää‚Äî‚Äägesticulating and all!

#### Uberconference

Many of the groups we work with are not the most technically savvy, and to assume they use Chrome as a browser was obnoxious, as we quickly learned. Enter: the dreaded conference line. Also, enter: your pin now.

[Uberconference](https://www.uberconference.com) has been easy. It allows joining via computer and phone, and when folks are on their computer you can do screen shares.

### Process

#### **Morning intentions**

I mentioned this above with #upstream-intentions. Part of how we kick off our day is with a group video chat hitting a few important items for each team member:

1.  How did yesterday go?
2.  What‚Äôs the plan for today?
3.  Do you need anyone‚Äôs help?

It‚Äôs a pretty basic framework that keeps morning meetings concise and thoughtful. There have been plenty of occasions where someone may be wrapping a big effort up and isn‚Äôt sure what the next best thing is to work on. In those cases we look at current and prospective partners and hash out what might be the highest value next work.

#### **Upstream IRL**

I‚Äôm a strong believer in the power and potential of remote work for the right team. However, there are always some things that are better done in person. Take cooking together, for example.

![Amadou and Alden cook up the world‚Äôs tastiest pasta from¬†scratch.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*g4UgtOF5Das0t_hA29I8yA.jpeg)

Team bonding and long term planning are two such items for our team. Once a quarter, we pick a location and meet up in person. Sometimes it‚Äôs San Francisco at Natel Energy‚Äôs office. I‚Äôve hosted in Somerville. Most recently, we rented an Airbnb in the Berkshires for a contemplative, hiking and cooking-filled week together. Business plans we had talked about for ages clicked in new ways. Technical scopes coalesced in turn. We left the week with a renewed energy (renewable energy?!), a stronger bond and a clear path forward with our work.

#### **1-on-1s**

We all do 1-on-1s with one another on a regular basis. We try not to reschedule or push back. They‚Äôre important! Informal phone calls while on walks or video chats. Simple, but possibly the most important time for communicating with your remote teammates.

#### **Show and¬†tell**

I‚Äôve worked at companies where there is a set ‚ÄúShow and Tell‚Äù slot on the calendar. It works great for large teams. Since we are small (and remote), we try to have a constant show and tell: do something neat over the weekend? Put it in slack! New screenshots of the prettier graphs you‚Äôre developing? ‚åòV! Want to do a video walkthrough of a surprisingly accurate ML model? Drop a hangout link and show us. Constant sharing and celebration of work has made it just as exciting as running over to someone‚Äôs desk, and is far more inclusive.

It‚Äôs been an awesome few years, and I‚Äôm excited for many more to come. I‚Äôm sure most of how we work is par for the startup course these days, but I hope for some, it‚Äôs an interesting look into our daily routine.

And obligatorily: if the way we work sounds fun and our mission resonates, our team is [growing](https://upstream.tech/about/team)! Send me a message at marshall@upstream.tech üôã‚Äç
