The book examines an insular high rise community gone awry. Petty complaints
devolve into all out destruction. Class -- I mean, floor -- warfare breaks
out, and tenants become primal, raiding other floors, destroying property, and worse.
Similar to _Foundation_ I don't think there was a single female character,
except as objects of war and conquest. It was a pretty disgusting book and I
skimmed the last half in search of redemption. There was none.
