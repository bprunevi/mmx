Recommended to me by my downstairs neighbor, Kate, this book is held up by its
premise. Strange ultra-massive bodyparts start to be uncovered
across the world of some large humanoid machine. It's structured as a series
of military transcripts you're reading after the fact. It's a quick read, and
equally fast paced.
