The premise for this book was enough to catch my science fiction junkie
attention, and it came as a recommendation from a new friend, John. Set in a
feudalistic galactic civilization future, there are multi-bodied AI
consiousnesses that are sentient tools of a crazy ruler. Typing that out it
sounds very odd. Anyway, the protagonist is one of these beings, which makes
for an interesting multi-body point of view.
