Okay, who saw the Peter Jackson trailer of the giant city-ships consuming
smaller city-ships and wasn't blown away? The trailer, at least, had a
lot going for it. I had high hopes for the novel, but sadly they materialized
in an especially "young" young adult novel. I couldn't get past some of the
poor writing in spite of the somewhat interesting world building.
